    <h2 class="text--headline text--headline--2">So you want to be an ally.</h2>

    <p>Welcome to the <em>Guide to Allyship.</em></p>

    <p>Think of this guide as one of many starting points in your journey to become a better ally. This guide isn’t meant to be comprehensive nor is it perfect. There are people far more versed than I, who have dedicated their life’s work to this sort of education. I’ve listed those resources later in the guide should you decide to learn more.</p>

    <p>In light of recent events and tragedies, I’ve been hearing the word “ally” a lot. Many people want to be an “ally”, and even more people are unable to fulfill the duties allyship requires.</p>

    <p>I use the word “ally” loosely because I find it overused and often abused by those who label themselves “allies.” Despite its current misuse, using a different word would only cause confusion. As you read through this guide, be aware that your definition of “ally” may not be the same as the definition I’ll introduce you to.</p>

    <h3 class="text--headline text--headline--3">What’s so special about this guide?</h3>

    <p>There are already quite a few great guides out there, and I acknowledge their existence. What’s different about this guide is that I want it to be contributed to by people from all walks of life.</p>

    <p>I want this to be a resource where anyone who is considering becoming an ally understands the pros and cons of what being an ally entails. I want you to understand that you’re in collaboration with people whose very lives can change overnight because of systemic oppression.</p>

    <p>You can’t take being an ally lightly.</p>

    <p>In the summer of 2016, someone I considered an ally stood by and watched as I, a Black person, was berated by a racist. To make matters worse, I had a conversation with this person earlier in the day about the power allies can wield in situations of discrimination. But when the time came for them to take action, they were more interested in protecting their comfort.</p>

    <p>Upset, I couldn’t understand what happened. Did the conversation we had not get through? What was stopping them? Then it dawned on me:</p>

    <p><strong>Saying you’re an ally is much easier than actually being an ally. Saying you’re an ally looks good on paper, if you’re never taken to task for doing nothing.</strong></p>

    <p>Many claiming the word “ally” wear the phrase and ideology like an article of clothing, easily discarded when it’s no longer hip/safe to wear.</p>

    <p>If only those who are marginalized could cast away their identities with such confidence and ease.</p>

    <h2 class="text--headline text--headline--2" id="what-is-an-ally">What is an ally?</h2>

    <p>There’s a lot of discussion about what an ally is or is not. It’s even harder to define as the word gets carelessly tossed around by people who don’t experience oppresion. In fact, as I’ve grown older, I’ve moved away from the word “ally”. But I do believe that there is an opportunity to better define the word. The best definition of an ally that I’ve found comes from Roxane Gay, author of <em>Bad Feminist</em> in her article for <em>Marie Claire</em>, <a href="http://www.marieclaire.com/culture/features/a21423/roxane-gay-philando-castile-alton-sterling/" target="_blank">“On Making Black Lives Matter.”</a> In it, she notes:</p>

    <blockquote class="border--bl--medium space--mv--medium space--ml--medium space--pl--medium">
      <p class="text--emphasis">Black people do not need allies. We need people to stand up and take on the problems borne of oppression as their own, without remove or distance.</p>
      <p class="text--emphasis">We need people to do this even if they cannot fully understand what it’s like to be oppressed for their race or ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ability, class, religion, or other marker of identity. </p>
      <p class="text--emphasis">We need people to use common sense to figure out how to participate in social justice.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>To recap:</strong> Being an ally doesn’t necessarily mean you fully understand what it feels like to be oppressed. It means you are taking on the struggle as your own.</p>

    <p>A marginalized individual cannot easily cast away the weight of their identity shaped through oppression on a whim. They must carry that weight every single day, for better or for worse. An ally understands that this is a weight that they, too, must be willing to carry and never put down.</p>

    <h2 class="text--headline text--headline--2" id="why-allies-are-necessary">Why allies are necessary</h2>

    <p>Anyone has the potential to be an ally. Allies recognize that though they are not a member of the oppressed group(s) they support, they make a concerted effort to better understand the struggle, every single day.</p>

    <p>Because an ally might have more privilege and recognizes said privilege, they are powerful voices <em>alongside</em> oppressed ones.</p>

    <h2 class="text--headline text--headline--2" id="the-work-of-allyship">The work of allyship</h2>

    <p>Being an ally is hard work. Many of those who want to be allies are scared of making missteps that get them labeled as “-ist” or “-ic” (racist, sexist, transphobic, homophobic, etc). But as an ally, you are also affected by a system of oppression. This means that as an ally, there is much to unlearn and learn&mdash;mistakes are expected.</p>

    <p class="border--bl--medium space--mv--medium space--ml--medium space--pl--medium"><strong>As an ally, you need to be willing to own your mistakes and be proactive in your education.</strong></p>

    <p>If you refuse to acknowledge that your words and actions are inherently shaped and influenced by systemic oppression, you’re setting up yourself to fail. That is not the behavior of an ally. You’ll be complicit in the oppression of those you intend to help. If you choose not to understand this, but label yourself an “ally”, you’re essentially a wolf in sheep’s clothing. You’ll find ways to infiltrate vulnerable communities and you’ll wield far more power than someone who is outwardly “-ist” or “-ic” because you’re “trusted.”</p>

    <p>Just as society will not change overnight, neither will you. Here are some dos and don’ts that are incredibly important as you learn, grow, and step into the role of an ally.</p>

    <p class="text--emphasis space--mb--large">Contributed by <a href="https://github.com/presleyp" target="_blank">Presley Pizzo.</a> Please credit Presley when referencing this section.</p>

    <p>While mistakes are to be expected, what’s the best way to go about resolving them?</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Parts of this section were originally based on
    <a href="https://twitter.com/iKaylaReed/status/742243143030972416" target="_blank">Kayla Reed’s (<a href="https://twitter.com/iKaylaReed" target="_blank">@iKaylaReed</a>) tweet that defines how she views what it means to be an ally.</a> -
      it’s a great definition and should help you follow along!</p>

    <p>Imagine your privilege is a heavy boot that keeps you from feeling when you’re stepping on someone’s feet or they’re stepping on yours, while oppressed people have only sandals. “Ouch! You’re stepping on my toes!” How do you react?</p>

    <p>Because we can think more clearly about stepping on someone’s literal toes than we usually do when it comes to oppression, the problems with many common responses are obvious:</p>

    <ul class="space--mv--large">
      <li><strong>Centering yourself:</strong> “I can’t believe you think I’m a toe-stepper! I’m a good person!”</li>

      <li><strong>Denial that others’ experiences are different from your own:</strong> “I don’t mind when people step on my toes.”</li>

      <li><strong>Derailing:</strong> “Some people don’t even have toes, why aren’t we talking about them instead?”</li>

      <li><strong>Refusal to center the impacted:</strong> “All toes matter!”</li>

      <li><strong>Tone policing:</strong> “I’d move my foot if you’d ask me more nicely.”</li>

      <li><strong>Denial that the problem is fixable:</strong> “Toes getting stepped on is a fact of life. You’ll be better off when you accept that.”</li>

      <li><strong>Victim blaming:</strong> “You shouldn’t have been walking around people with boots!”</li>

      <li><strong>Withdrawing:</strong> “I thought you wanted my help, but I guess not. I’ll just go home.”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In reality, most of us naturally know the right way to react when we step on someone’s toes, and we can use that to help us learn how to react when we commit microaggressions.</p>

    <ul class="space--mv--large">
      <li><strong>Center the impacted</strong>: “Are you okay?”</li>
      <li><strong>Listen to their response and learn.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Apologize for the impact, even though you didn’t intend it:</strong> “I’m sorry!”</li>
      <li><strong>Stop the instance:</strong> move your foot</li>
      <li><strong>Stop the pattern:</strong> be careful where you step in the future. When it comes to oppression, we want to actually change the “footwear” to get rid of privilege and oppression (sneakers for all!), but metaphors can only stretch so far!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Reacting in a fair and helpful way isn’t about learning arbitrary rules or being a doormat. When we take the politics out of it, it’s just the <em>reasonable</em> thing to do. Still, it’s hard to remember in the moment, because these issues are so charged in our society. As such, it may be helpful to reframe the situation so that you don’t feel defensive.</p>

    <p>You may have noticed it’s easier to handle being corrected about something you didn’t know if you’re grateful for and even open to the opportunity to learn rather than embarrassed to have been wrong. Being able to let go of your ego is an incredibly important skill to develop.</p>

    <p>Try starting with “Thanks for letting me know” to put yourself in a better frame of mind. If after you say that, you need to take some time to think about the situation, that’s fine, too. Just remember that this isn’t about changing the other person’s frame of mind. They’re allowed to be upset about being oppressed.</p>
